<p>The game direction changes midway through 2020. Let’s go through some key ideas.</p>
<ol>
<li>The developers of the game essentially decided to make a change in game direction: players should not have a hard time farming if they don’t want to. Give players options - many options. And instead focus on story and gameplay versatility. Lower the HP values of enemies. Make almost all battles have two or three enemies per room so refund is possible. If you want to braindead SS farm you can. If you want to do standard buster farming, you can. If you want to arts loop, you can (paracelsus strengthening). If you want to facecard, you can. This change takes time to manifest and arrives with Lostbelt &amp; Annversary Skadi &amp; new Summer Event.</li>
<li>A strong focus on both Lostbelt story and Event story. Hype.</li>
<li>Minor note - story fights will generally be a pushover until Lostbelt 3 16-1.</li>
<li>A focus on event challenge quest design. Event challenge quests will be generally easy to complete <em>if you know the mechanics</em>, and rewarding to min-turn with various units. (Naturally, if you don’t have the time to care about CQs, that’s totally fine too.)<br>
– HP is generally lower but mechanics are punishing if not properly dealt with. Interesting breakbar mechanics are used.<br>
– Multiple enemies perfect for breakbar refunding with AoE Units; expect potential clears with large crits and NP spamming after regaining NP gauge with NP attack chains<br>
– Very difficult challenge quests aren’t generally stat-checks but instead knowledge-checks due to many different and unique mechanics<br>
– All of these new 2020 servants that get released and aren’t SS farmers - what are they for? What about all those old units that we never used but people say are strong (e.g. Okita, MHX, MHXA, Melt, Kiara, Tesla, Karna, etc.) used for? For abusing breakbar CQs and esports.<br>
– Buster is not dead and actually remains quite alive in the future for boss fights. Strong buster servants generally have immense potential in NP gain from art cards and crits from buster. Buster NP ‘looping’ is indeed a possibility with NP+AA and/or breakbars can be cleared with just giga crits.</li>
<li>Players who only roll for gameplay (aren’t waifu collectors/completionists) and don’t care about either story (both Lostbelt and Events) or event CQ optimized runs (be it esports or budget setups), will find that the game becomes very boring very quickly. There are very few specific must-have servants, and the double Skadi system simply trivializes farming. If you do not intentionally go out of your way to have fun with different farming teams, you will just end just doing the same old double Skadi setup over and over and over again until the end of time. If you do not care about cool CQ runs, then you will just find CQs either too easy to brute force or too annoying to learn the mechanics for. There is little reason to deviate unless you motivate yourself. “Why even farm materials for servants if you’re not going to use them? Why even roll for all these servants both new and old? Why are there so many events one after another, and what is the point?” are common questions.</li>
<li>Good luck and have fun my friends.<br>
Cheers,<br>
SoA</li>

<h1 id="stuff">Stuff</h1>
<ul>
<li>SS = double skadi | SSW = double skadi + waver | SSBride = double skadi + nerobride</li>
<li>Surfmo System | Jarcher System = setups where mordred rider or jeanne archer 3xNP 3-turn farm</li>
<li>Facecard efficiency = NP gain and star generation performance of facecards</li>
<li>Esports = Completing challenge quest in minimum number of turns (contrast with regular clear of CQ). Requires significant amount of planning with assembling arrangement of servants and mathematically computing outputs and possibilities of each turn. Usually involves NP looping + extreme facecard efficiency + resetting hundreds of attempts to get crits and desired facecards + possibly depending on specific servants to die to cycle in new servants (see below).</li>
<li>Esports-ready support: level 1 or min-ascension CQ-focused supports with crucial skills unlocked and max skilled. Minimize HP to maximize chance of dying to enemy attacks. e.g. lvl1 Abigail, lvl1 Sherlock, lvl50 3rd-ascension Chiron, lvl50 2nd-ascension Nerobride, etc.</li>

<td>Default challenge quest arts-team AoE DPS for the next two years.</td>
<td>See CQ? Use Hokusai if you don’t care about esports (min-turning) and just want easy time. Note that most CQs in the future are AoE. Anti-‘man’-attribute SE applies to both servants and trashmobs. Does not care what class the enemies are since she takes neutral damage. Stacking defense-down with arts attacks. 30% battery, ~10% refund per enemy before buffs. Slow and steady refund NP loop.</td>

<td>Buster</td>
<td>AoE Assassin</td>
<td>Well-balanced AoE assassin. Low NP output until NP strengthening in one year.</td>
<td>Buster NP and 30% battery fit with Merlin for farming. Strong hybrid defensive team kit similar in a way to Ereshkigal. Decent NP gain, stargen, facecards. Triple Arts caster deck makes her a candidate for “buster loop” memes. Second skill makes her neutral versus casters (takes neutral damage, does neutral damage), which makes her versatile for working through multi-class AoE CQs without worrying about class weakness. NP output is disappointing until strengthening in 2021, which makes it acceptable. Still weaker than Shuten for 3-turn farming even after strengthening. Better than Shuten in other environments. Generally favored over Cleopatra except for facecard efficiency. Buster-down requires 8 crit stars, and output is very low without this debuff.</td>

<td>Versatile double Skadi Rider. Spookable.</td>
<td>Well designed kit with versatile skills. 3-turn quick and crit str buffs, invincibility, defense-up, taunt, 30% battery. A popular double Skadi looper for farming, but refund is very tight. Looping is totally dependent on the battery / mystic code. Generally failsafe with F2004 MC. Quite dominant in CQs.</td>

<td>Okita Alter</td>
<td>Buster</td>
<td>AoE Alter Ego</td>
<td>Straightforward buster AoE 30% battery farmer with great facecard efficiency who falls very hard victim to Skadi meta.</td>
<td>When she was released, JP blogs immediately gave her a S-tier farming rating due to good offensive self-buffs and 30% battery perfect for use with Merlin. This made her a versatile cavalry-killer who compared very favorably with AoE assassins at the time. Unfortunately, the Skadi meta arrives just one month later. SS looping deprecates 30% battery buster farming in both output and setup simplicity. Furthermore, all three AoE assassins (Cleo, Shuten, Semi), Okitan’s competitors, receive NP strengthenings in the next half year and Okitan’s output falls behind. Animations and very high card efficiency still make Okitan fun to use.</td>

<td>Valkyrie (SR)</td>
<td>Quick</td>
<td>AoE Lancer</td>
<td>Top tier double Skadi farming lancer</td>
<td>Usage is interchangeable with Parvati. Higher inherent refund than Parvati but Parvati has a back-up battery. Higher W2 output than Parvati but lower W3 output -&gt; Parvati has much higher burst potential: Parvati’s W3 output is tied to her 1-turn attack buff. (Valk has higher output than Parvati when that attack-buff is not activated.) In practice, this tradeoff simply dictates where you use your two Skadi’s def-downs to get equivalent output. With Valk, you use two def-downs on W3. With Parv, you use one def-down on W2 and one def-down on W3.</td>

<td>Jeanne Archer</td>

<td>AoE Archer</td>
<td>SSR Arts Farming Looper (think SSR Mordred Rider) with 40% charisma for “good” teammates</td>
<td>One of few servants in the game who can 3-turn 100% arts refund with just two supports - the other servant generally being Mordred Rider (who refunds even harder but has lower output). Da Vinci Rider and Space Ishtar can also triple NP in specific instances with only two supports while universally doing so with three supports. Jarcher can alternatively double NP without any art support loop to clear W1 &amp; W2 and leave W3 for someone else while also buffing them with 40% charisma. Finds usage in event farming and Gilfest1 lotto farming before Tamamo and Nerobride strengthenings. Usage increases with NY2021 Tamamo strengthening. After Anni2021 Bride strengthening, versatile “JArcher Farming System(s)” become popular. Can be used for 2021 lotto farming as well. Like Mordred Rider, low base NP output necessitates very high NP levels for comfortable farming. Serves as an alternative to double Skadi System (or traditional buster setups) in appropriate situations.</td>

<td>AoE Moon Cancer</td>
<td>Cardlock can be gameplay breaking for CQs. Has 50% battery but usually not used as DPS except for low HP trashmobs.</td>
<td>Locks facecard choices for 3-turns unless some servant dies or gets swapped. This mechanic is inevitably gamebreaking due to ability to allow your main DPS to brave chain for 3-turns. NPBB, NPAA, NPQQ repeatedly, etc. for NP looping versus break bars. Surprisingly not used often in esports because you can afford to reset game until you get the desired facecards and you do not want to waste a spot in your lineup on a non-buffing support. Can also be used as a neutral damage AoE DPS for low-HP enemies (think W1 or W2) due to her 50% battery.</td>

NP 150% SE vs Saber-class servants. Strong crit damage and star generation. Used mainly when you just want to have some fun over several turns and prepare for NP burst and facecard crits since it’s essentially impossible to find appropriate targets for her powermod.

The 3-turn loop is highly dependent on 20% battery, proper mystic code choice, overkill hits. The 20% battery, interestingly, is targetable and also removes debuffs.
